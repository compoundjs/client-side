        <h2>Client-side features for CompoundJS</h2>

<p>This package adds number of client-side features to
<a href="http://compoundjs.com">CompoundJS MVC</a>. To get idea of client-side compound
see how GitHub works when you browsing repository: every page could
be loaded as html, but when you navigate through pages by clicking links, it
doesn't reloads page. It's like pjax, but without pjax: everything rendered and
served on client.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Step 1. install using npm:</p>

<pre><code>npm install co-client --save
</code></pre>

<p>Step 2. add <code>co-client</code> line to config/autoload.js, for example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">module</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">exports</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">compound</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">typeof</span> <span class="nb">window</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="s1">'undefined'</span> <span class="o">?</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="s1">'ejs-ext'</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">'jugglingdb'</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">'seedjs'</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">'co-client'</span>
    <span class="p">].</span><span class="nx">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="c1">// some client-side modules</span>
    <span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Work with compoundjs as usual, bundle will created on server startup. To rebuild
bundle on file modification use <code>compound g cs --watch</code> command.</p>

<p>One important note: this module uses &lt;%- contentFor('javascripts') %&gt; section of
application layout. If you want to use client-side compound in existing app you
should add following line to end of your
app/views/layouts/application_layout.js:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%- contentFor('javascripts') %&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>CLI features</h2>

<h3>Bundle generator</h3>

<pre><code>compound generate clientside
</code></pre>

<p>or, using shortcuts</p>

<pre><code>compound g cs
</code></pre>

<p>This generator creates bundle which consists of framework, application and all
dependencies. This bundle saved as <code>public/javascripts/compound.js</code> file, it
should be included on client.</p>

<h3>Watch for changes</h3>

<p>Generator can stay alive and look for changes in application code and rebuild
bundle if it called with <code>--watch</code> flag.</p>

<pre><code>compound g cs --watch
</code></pre>

<h3>ORM</h3>

<p>Client-Side Compound comes with JugglingDB ORM, which works well on client-side,
but for persistence it still talk to server using JSON API, provided by controller.</p>

<p>If you don't need persistence, just tell compound to use another schema driver (by
default used WebServiceAdapter). Config example:</p>

<pre><code>app.set('schema adapter', require('jugglingdb/lib/adapters/memory'));
</code></pre>

<p>It will force JugglingDB to use in-memory storage, which is not persistent. Feel free
to write your own adapter if you have some API for your client-side app.</p>

<h3>Client-Side Controllers</h3>

<p>Same controller serves both HTML and JSON requests, more than that: same controller works
on client-side.</p>

<h3>Routing</h3>

<p>Use regular compound routing to tell framework, which controller#action should respond to
request on given path. One addition to routes. Every route now have <code>pushState</code> param which
allows to specify, is it necessary to populate browser's history when serving this action.
By default <code>pushState: true</code>, that means every click and form submission will update location
and history. Use <code>pushState: false</code> to disable this behavior:</p>

<pre><code>app.get('#displayAlert', 'clientSideConrtoller#alert', {pushState: false});
</code></pre>

<h3>More awesome stuff coming soon...</h3>
